/**
 * This class is just a temporary location to hold dragSource in a DnD operation. Typically we should not have used such
 * a class to keep track of dragSource. Instead we should use a transfer class. But because of following I use it: 1.
 * Using a transfer is not guaranteed to work on all platforms and always. 2. On platforms other than windows dragSource
 * is not set until drop event fires, and we need dragSource during events like dragOver. 3. We are not planning to drop
 * something out of ECP environment, i.e. form ECP navigator on file system. This class is a singleton.
